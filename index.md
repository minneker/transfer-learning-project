## Welcome to my final project page!

We set out to use deep transfer learning with popular convolutional neural network architectures to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD) from images of handwritten spirals (i.e. classify healthy vs. PD spirals). We used popular image classification network weights, such as VGG-16, for transfer learning, and open source datasets such as the [UCI Machine Learning repository PD spiral dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Disease+Spiral+Drawings+Using+Digitized+Graphics+Tablet) or this Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/parkinsons-drawings). Transfer learning is the method of choice because the datasets of PD spirals are very small (on the order of ~50 images per class); we show that [INSERT QUANT RESULT HERE].

## Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder with no cure and unknown etiology. Treatment can help slow disease progression and increase quality of life if symptoms are detected early enough. A common [clinical test](https://pn.bmj.com/content/17/6/456) involves the patient drawing on a piece of paper, which the physician then examines for evidence of early signs of PD tremors. This is a classification problem that can be aided by deep learning, particularly there is an opportunity here to introduce quantitative analysis on a currently qualitative task; if effective, such methods could perform large scale diagnostics (e.g. via a mobile phone app) to help detect PD in early stages and help researchers and clinicians to understand, track and ultimately treat PD more effectively than current methods allow.

In this section the problem you are working on. Maybe talk about why you thought it was interesting. Or why you think it needs to get solved.

You may also want to say a little bit here about what you did. Not too much though. Don't give the whole game away.

## Related Work

Other people are out there doing things. What did they do? Was it good? Was it bad? Talk about it here.

## Approach

How did you decide to solve the problem? What network architecture did you use? What data? Lots of details here about all the things you did. This section describes almost your whole project.

Figures are good here. Maybe you present your network architecture or show some example data points?

## Results

How did you evaluate your approach? How well did you do? What are you comparing to? Maybe you want ablation studies or comparisons of different methods.

You may want some qualitative results and quantitative results. Example images/text/whatever are good. Charts are also good. Maybe loss curves or AUC charts. Whatever makes sense for your evaluation.

## Discussion

You can talk about your results and the stuff you've learned here if you want. Or discuss other things. Really whatever you want, it's your project.
